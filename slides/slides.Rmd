# Goals

The goal of this workshop is to provide *practical* advice for research projects:

* you can implement these tips now
* thess skills will scale
  - more complex projects
  - more collaborators

---

# Motivations

* organizing your projects and data will:
  - improve reproducibility
  - make the work more accessible for others

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* describe and apply principles for organizing and naming files and folders
* employ the concept of tidy data for structuring tabular data
* import and view tabular data in R

# File and Folder Organization

---

# Principles for Organization

* You don't want to spend time looking for stuff.
  - Using a consistent system builds up habits.
* Keep all project files in a single project folder.
* Include a project README file that describes the project.
* Separate sub-folders for raw data, processed data, code, figures.

---

# General Folders I have

# Naming Things

---

# Principles

Choose file names that are:
* machine-readable
* human-readable
* plays well with default ordering

---

# Examples (BAD)

```
Drake's FILES with spaces and punctuation.xlsx
figure 1.png
fig 2.png
report on DEC1 final FINAL HY-comments ver3.docx
```

---

# Examples (GOOD)

```
drakes-files-are-getting-better.xlsx
fig01_scatterplot_length-vs-interest.png
fig02_histogram_talk-attendance.png
report-on-DEC1_2020-06-01_HY-comments.docx
```

---
# Machine-Readable

* Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, mixing capital and lower-case.
* Use underscore `'_'` to separate grouping levels.
* Use hyphen `'-'` to separate words within a level.

---

# Human-Readable

* Use filenames that will help you find it later.
* Use nouns for objects, use verbs for actions:
  - e.g. `load-data.R`, `mtcars_measurements.csv`

---

# Using Default Ordering

* Files are usually sorted alphabetically
  - we can make use of this!
* Left-pad with numbers to order steps in a sequence:
  - e.g. `01_load-data.R`, `02_process-data.R`
* Use ISO-8601 for dates:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` format (when files are sorted alphabetically, this format makes the order chronological, too!)

# Structuring Tabular Data

---

# Principles

Make it easy for anyone to work with your data:
* Structure data for analysis (i.e. "Tidy Data")
* Don't use spreadsheet-formatting to store data!
* Keep raw data raw
* Include a Data Dictionary

---

# Tidy Data

Properties of *tidy data*:
* each column is a variable
* each row is an observation
* each table is a single observational unit

---

# Common issues

* data values are stored in column headers
  - e.g. dosage, date
* multiple variables stored in one column
* some variables are stored in rows in addition to columns
* "1 observational unit = 1 table" is violated

---

# Examples

```{r prep data, include = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
dat <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Canada", "Chile", "Italy", "Sudan", "Thailand"),
         year > 2000) %>%
  select(country, continent, year, pop)
```

*untidy data*

```{r echo = FALSE}
dat %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = year, 
                     values_from = pop) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

# Examples

*tidy data*

```{r echo = FALSE}
dat %>%
  head(6) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

---

# Spreadsheet Formatting

* prefer empty cells or `'NA'` for missing data
  - *be careful about `'NA'` for certain types of data (e.g. it can mean "Namibia")*
* do NOT space out data with empty rows/columns
* do NOT use text formatting (e.g. bold/italics) to store information
  - conditional formatting can help visualize
* Excel LOVES to convert data into a date format

---

# Raw Data

* store raw data for reproducibility
  - e.g. if analysis tools change (as in bioinformatics workflows)
* document processing steps in code or text
  - someone else can see what processing was done, and reproduce it

---

# Data Dictionary

* define what your rows and columns are
  - e.g. are your observations?
    + individual subjects
    + OR data collection sessions
    + OR individual samples from a measurement device
* define codes and categories
  - e.g. country codes, species codes, acronyms
* define relationships between multiple tables

# Reading Data into R

---

# Basics of R and RStudio

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the programming language
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is *optional* software that provides an interface to working in R
  - **highly recommended** unless you have strong preferences and experience doing programming in a different environment
  - there are lots of versions for commercial clients, you probably want the free Desktop version -- https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

---

# R Packages

The functionality of R is extended by *packages*:
* open-source, developed by community members
  - sometimes individuals, sometimes large teams
* vary in scope:
  - color themes from Wes Anderson movies
  - tools for making interactive web applications

---

# Ways to Get Data into R

* datasets included with R and packages
  - `data()`
* read in data files
  - comma-separated values (`.csv`) tables
  - R binary formats (`.Rdata`, `.Rda`, `.RDS`)
* directly from Google Sheets
  - [`googlesheets4`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package
* directly from Excel
  - [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package

---

# Demo (reading in CSV)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dat <- read.csv("data/gapminder_demo.csv")
```

---

# Demo (`googlesheets4`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("googlesheets4")
library(googlesheets4)

gs4_deauth() # don't authenticate, we just want to read a publicly-visible document

dat <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16apE3bvGjPqyeXqWUnKgBlvGxi7GoJ4_T8OzHpYRA4k/edit?usp=sharing")
```

---

# Demo (`readxl`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

dat <- read_excel("data/gapminder_demo.xlsx")
```
