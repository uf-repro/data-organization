# Goals

The goal of this workshop is to provide *practical* advice for research projects:

* you can implement these tips now
* thess skills will scale
  - more complex projects
  - more collaborators

---

# Motivations

* organizing your projects and data will:
  - improve reproducibility
  - make the work more accessible for others

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* describe and apply principles for organizing and naming files and folders
* employ the concept of tidy data for structuring tabular data
* import and view tabular data in R

# File and Folder Organization

---

# Principles for Organization

* You don't want to spend time looking for a file or a particular version.
* Using a consistent system will build up habits for storing and finding files.
* Keep all project files in a single project folder.
* Include a project README file that describes the project.
* Separate sub-folders for raw data, processed data, code, figures.

# Naming Things

---

# Principles

Choose file names that are:
* machine-readable
* human-readable
* plays well with default ordering

---

# Machine-Readable

* Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, mixing capital and lower-case.
* Use underscore `'_'` to separate grouping levels.
* Use hyphen `'-'` to separate words within a level.

---

# Human-Readable

* Use filenames that will help you find it later.
* Use nouns for objects, use verbs for actions:
  - e.g. `load-data.R`, `mtcars_measurements.csv`

---

# Using Default Ordering

* Files are usually sorted alphabetically
  - we can make use of this!
* Left-pad with numbers to order steps in a sequence:
  - e.g. `01_load-data.R`, `02_process-data.R`
* Use ISO-8601 for dates:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` format (when files are sorted alphabetically, this format makes the order chronological, too!)

# Structuring Tabular Data

---

# Principles

Make it easy for anyone to work with your data:
* Structure data for analysis (i.e. "Tidy Data")
* Don't use spreadsheet-formatting to store data!
* Keep raw data raw
* Include a Data Dictionary

---

# Tidy Data

Properties of *tidy data*:
* each column is a variable
* each row is an observation
* each table is a single observational unit

---

# Common issues

* data values are stored in column headers
  - e.g. dosage, date
* multiple variables stored in one column
* some variables are stored in rows in addition to columns
* "1 observational unit = 1 table" is violated

---

# Examples

```{r prep data, include = FALSE}
# library(gapminder)
# library(dplyr)
# dat <- gapminder %>% 
#   filter(country %in% c("Canada", "Chile", "Italy", "Sudan", "Thailand"), year > 2000) %>%
#   select(country, continent, year, pop)
```






---

# Spreadsheet Formatting

* prefer empty cells or `'NA'` for missing data
  - *be careful about `'NA'` for certain types of data (e.g. it can mean "Namibia")*
* do NOT space out data with empty rows/columns
* do NOT use text formatting (e.g. bold/italics) to store information
  - conditional formatting can help visualize
* Excel LOVES to convert data into a date format

---

# Raw Data

* store raw data for reproducibility
  - e.g. if analysis tools change (as in bioinformatics workflows)
* document processing steps in code or text
  - someone else can see what processing was done, and reproduce it

---

# Data Dictionary

* define what your rows and columns are
  - e.g. are your observatons:
    + individual subjects
    + OR data collection sessions
    + OR individual samples from a measurement device
* define codes and categories
  - e.g. country codes, species codes, acronyms
* define relationships between multiple tables

# Reading Data into R

---

# Basics of R and RStudio

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the programming language
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is *optional* software that provides an interface to working in R
  - **highly recommended** unless you have strong preferences and experience doing programming in a different environment

---

# R Packages

The functionality of R is extended by *packages*:
* open-source, developed by community members
  - sometimes individuals, sometimes large teams
* vary in scope:
  - color themes from Wes Anderson movies
  - tools for making interactive web applications

---

# Ways to Get Data into R

* read in data files
  - comma-separated values (`.csv`) tables
  - R binary formats (`.Rdata`, `.Rda`, `.RDS`)
* directly from Google Sheets
  - [`googlesheets4`](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) package
* directly from Excel
  - [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) package
