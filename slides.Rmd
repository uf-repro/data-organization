# Goals

The goal of this workshop is to provide *practical* advice for research projects:

* you can implement these tips now
* thess skills will scale
  - more complex projects
  - more collaborators

---

# Motivations

* organizing your projects and data will:
  - improve reproducibility
  - make the work more accessible for others

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* describe and apply principles for organizing and naming files and folders
* employ the concept of tidy data for structuring tabular data
* import and view tabular data in R
