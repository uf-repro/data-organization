# Motivations

Why should you care about this topic?

--

Organizing your projects and data will:
* improve reproducibility
* facilitate scaling up of projects
* make it easier for anyone to build off it later
--

  **this includes yourself at a later point!**

---

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

* better organize file and folders for research projects
* use and apply file naming conventions
* understand the principles of tidy data for structuring tabular data

# File and Folder Organization

---

# Principles

* You don't want to spend time looking for stuff.
  The same is true for your collaborators.
  - Keep all files associated with a project in **one** place.
* Document key decisions about the project.
  - Anyone with access to the project folder should be able to access information about data, results, etc.
---

# Practices

* Use sub-folders to organize data, figures, manuscript, etc.
  - separate raw and processed data
* Maintain documentation on:
  - who did the experiments
  - the formatting of the data
    (more on this later)
  - when/how/why

---

# Structuring a Project Folder

<pre class = "hljs remark-code">
project/
├── data/
├── figures/
├── output/
├── paper/
├── R/
└── README.md
</pre>

--
* more examples in [Marwick et al. 2018 "Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986)

---
# A Project README

* short summary of project & goals
* include guidance for the most common/important task
  - (software) how to install and run it
  - (paper) which file is the final report/paper
  - (data) the summary figure or main file
* acknowledgments
* how to cite the work

---

# Higher-level organization

I group project folders based on task:

<pre class = "hljs remark-code">
hye/
├── grants/
├── presentations_and_travel/
├── projects/
├── teaching/
├── vitae/
└── websites/
</pre>
--
* easier to copy-paste from existing projects

---
# Summary

* for individual project, store files and **information** in the same place
  - don't rely on memory!
* make the project easy to navigate and engage with:
  - if someone is looking for details, they know where to look

# Naming Things

---

# Principles

Choose file names that:
* are machine-readable
* are human-readable
* play well with default ordering

---

# Examples (NOT SO GOOD)

<pre class = "hljs remark-code">
Hao's data with spaces & punctuation.xlsx
01.R
figure 1.png
fig 2.jpg
report-final FINAL HY-comments ver3.docx
</pre>

---

# Examples (BETTER)

<pre class = "hljs remark-code">
hao_learned_about_underscores.xlsx
01_import-data.R
fig01_scatterplot_length-vs-interest.png
fig02_histogram_talk-attendance.png
yearly-report_2020-06-01_hy-comments.docx
</pre>

---
# Machine-Readable

* Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, mixing capital and lower-case.
  - computers and filesystems can struggle with these
  - easier names help people remember, too!
* Separate words with hyphens `'-'`
* Separate metadata groups with underscores `'_'`

---

# Human-Readable

* Use filenames that will help you find it later.
* For code, use nouns for data objects and verbs for actions:
  - `load-data.R`
  - `mtcars_measurements.csv`
  - `make-scatterplot.R`

---

# Using Default Ordering

* Computers like to sort files alphabetically:
  - we can make use of this!
* Left-pad with numbers to impose an order on files:
  - e.g. `01_load-data.R`, `02_process-data.R`
* Use ISO-8601 for dates:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD` format (alphabetical sorting makes it chronological, too!)

# Example

<pre class = "hljs remark-code">

siteA_2020-05-01_animal-count.xls
siteB_2020-04-01_animal-count.xls
siteB_2020-04-01_weather.dat
siteB_2020-05-01_animal-count.xls
siteB_2020-05-01_weather.dat
</pre>

--
* files are organized by site
  - dates of data collection are visible
  - for a given site and date, types of measurement are clear

---

# Summary

* you probably use names to organize files already!
  - these tips can help improve your system
* use a consistent scheme for labeling

# Structuring Tabular Data

---

# Principles

Make it easy for anyone to work with your data:
* Structure data for analysis (i.e. "Tidy Data")
* Don't use text-formatting to store information!
* Don't modify raw data
* Include a Data Dictionary

---

# Tidy Data

Properties of *tidy data*:
* each column is a variable
* each row is an observation
* each table is a single observational unit

---

# Common issues

* data values are stored in column headers
  - e.g. treatment values, dates of sampling
* multiple variables are stored in one column
* some variables are stored in rows in addition to columns
* "1 observational unit = 1 table" is violated
  - e.g. subject info and samples are stored in one table

---

# Spreadsheet Formatting

* prefer empty cells or `'NA'` for missing data
  - *be careful about `'NA'` for certain types of data (e.g. country code for "Namibia")*
* do NOT space out data with empty rows/columns
* do NOT use text formatting (e.g. bold/italics) to store information
* Excel LOVES to convert data into a date format

---
# Spreadsheet Example

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 10 from Broman & Woo \"Data Organization in Spreadsheets\", showing a data table with an outlier highlighted in red as an example of bad formatting, and then an alternative where the outlier status is encoded in its own column."}
knitr::include_graphics("spreadsheet_formatting.png")
```

Instead of highlighting the cells with outliers, encode outlier status as its own column.

---

# Raw Data

* store raw data for reproducibility
  - copy and modify files instead
  - and/or use scripts to clean/wrangle raw data
* document processing steps in code or text
  - someone else can see what processing was done, and reproduce it
  - OpenRefine is a great tool for cleaning messy data (and records the steps for you)!

---

# Data Dictionary

* define your rows and columns are
  - e.g. do rows correspond to:
     + individual subjects
     + OR data collection sessions
     + OR individual samples from a measurement device
* define codes, categories, acronyms
* define relationships between multiple tables
* [more detail on metadata](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/datamanagement/metadata)

|name|plot_name|group|description|type|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|mouse|Mouse|demographic|Animal identifier|text|
|sex|Sex|demographic|Male (M) or Female (F)|factor|
