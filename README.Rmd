## Description

`r lesson_description`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("implement recommended practices for file and folder organization in projects", 
                       "use and apply file naming conventions", 
                       "understand the principles of tidy data for structuring tabular data")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`

```{r make cff file, include = FALSE}
cffr::cff_write(keys = list("type" = "lesson"))
```
